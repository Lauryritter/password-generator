# Random Password Generator

This was a project in which we were assigned a task to create a random password generator that included that the password be between 8-128 characters long, have options for if the user wanted special characters, numbers, uppercase letters and lowercase letters.  The user could also input the number of characters they wanted to have output.

## Getting Started

We were provided with the html and css templates for the project.  The project runs on an internet link.  I used Google Chrome.  

### Prerequisites

I used GitHub, GitBash, Visual Studio Code and Google Chrome to get this application up.

```
GitBash was used for my terminal to link the code from Visual Studio Code to GitHub.  Then it was launched on Google Chrome.
```

### Installing

Pull up the website on Google Chrome.  Click on "Generate Password" button.

```
See passgen begin.PNG attached.
```

A popup will show giving a prompt for how long you want the password to be.

```
See passgen 2.PNG attached.
```

It will then lead you through a series of prompts and generate a password at the end, unfortunately, I was unable to get the formula correct to accomplish this.
